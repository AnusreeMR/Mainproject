INTRODUCTION

The entertainment industry has significantly evolved with advancements in technology, especially in how customers book movie tickets and access personalized recommendations. Despite the availability of online ticket booking, many theaters still rely on manual processes, leading to inefficiencies such as long queues, difficulties in managing customer demands, and a lack of flexible refund options. This reliance on traditional systems often results in a disjointed customer experience, reducing overall satisfaction. Additionally, the absence of personalized movie suggestions limits user engagement and fails to cater to individual preferences effectively.  

To address these challenges, a comprehensive movie booking, flexi ticket, and recommendation system tailored for Mukkom ARC (Abhilash-Rose Cinemas) has been proposed. The system introduces an efficient online platform that enables users to browse available theaters, explore movie schedules, select preferred showtimes, and seamlessly book tickets. It eliminates the need for manual interventions and reduces the time required to secure bookings. By providing real-time updates on seat availability and detailed movie schedules, the system ensures that users can make informed decisions.  

A key innovation of the system is the introduction of flexi tickets, allowing users the flexibility to leave a movie screening at any time and receive a refund based on their remaining viewing duration. Unlike standard tickets, flexi tickets come with a 10% additional charge, and refunds are calculated based on how much of the movie remains unwatched. For instance, if a user leaves after watching less than 25% of the movie, they can receive a 90% refund, whereas those leaving after viewing more than 75% will receive 60% of their ticket price back. This feature enhances customer convenience and ensures a more adaptable movie-watching experience.  

Additionally, the system includes an advanced movie recommendation engine, which delivers personalized movie suggestions based on users' viewing histories and preferences. This not only enhances user engagement but also creates a tailored experience that encourages repeat visits. The system also features movie ratings and reviews, allowing users to share their opinions and guide others. A well-organized movie-watching history feature helps users track past bookings while refining the recommendation algorithm.  

For theater operators, the system offers comprehensive tools to efficiently manage theaters, movies, and showtimes. Operators can monitor seat availability, process standard and flexi ticket refund requests, and respond to customer feedback, ensuring a seamless experience for all stakeholders. Administrators gain centralized control over user management, theater operations, and complaint resolution, enhancing operational efficiency.  

This innovative solution represents a transformative step for Mukkom ARC (Abhilash-Rose Cinemas), positioning it as a modern, customer-centric establishment in the entertainment industry. By integrating streamlined ticket booking, flexible refund options through flexi tickets, personalized recommendations, and efficient theater management, the system is designed to improve user convenience, enhance engagement, and boost ticket sales.
